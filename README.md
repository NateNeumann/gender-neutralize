<h2>Gender Neutralize</h2>
Chrome extension to turn unnecessarily gendered words into their gender-neutral alternatives across the web. Currently covers traditional male and female pronouns, relational titles (e.g. "boyfriend", "daughter"), professional and occupational titles (e.g. "Congressman"), and more -- check content_script.js for a full list.  

<h4>Contribution:</h4>
The codebase will always be open source; while users are welcome to modify to make their own modifications/updates, in the spirit of communal development, please submit a Pull Request and I'll see if I can incorporate your changes into the full build! 
Nothing about the app is monetized in any way, so support and updates is limited by my own free time -- if you have any additions or improvements, it makes a better extension for everyone.

<h4>Privacy Policy:</h4>

All information is modified locally, and the application does not collect or transmit any data about users.

If you have any concerns, suggestions, or questions about the extension, please contact me at sophie.a.debs@gmail.com.
